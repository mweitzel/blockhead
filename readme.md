The interpreter makes use of native JavaScript objects, so you both interpret blockhead scripts from JavaScript, and require .js modules from .bh land.

It is lisp-_like_, so in blockhead uses ( parens ) to hold scope and nest functions. But it also makes use of : colons : to separate and reduce blocks into eachother.
