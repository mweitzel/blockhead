The interpreter makes use of native JavaScript objects, so you can both interpret blockhead scripts from JavaScript, and require .js modules from .bh scripts.

It is lisp-_like_, so in blockhead uses `(` parens `)` to hold scope and nest functions. But it also makes use of `:` colons `:` to separate and reduce blocks into eachother.
